# Activites
Supposed to distinguish between various activites
This takes the z dimension train data. I applied a moving filter to the activities and plotted results. So far no definitive measure
for distinction has been developed. But different fit models are being worked on. If these models produce statistical differences, code
will be altered and will be shared on this github repository. Meanwhile plots are available for walking some with no filter and atleast
1 with a filter of 10 elements each.
